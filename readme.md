## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## About this minimal project

This project has already automatized certain tasks needed to work with vue on the frontend and to deploy such as:

 - Eslint and a default eslint config file
 - Prettier and a default prettier config file
 - A script that loads vue components in the components folder seemeless
 - Some basic bootstrap - vue components
 - A Procfile to allow deployment in heroku
 - A line of code in AppProvider that enforces the use of https to the asset function

## Install

1. ```composer install```

2. ```npm install```

3. ```php artisan migrate```

4. Use the ```.env.example``` file to create your own ```.env``` file

5. Once the database is set in the ```.env``` file run: ```php artisan key:generate```

The auth views are already created that's why instead of running 

```php artisan make:auth```

We are running running:

```php artisan migrate```
